# Memory-Card

A responsive memory card game inspired by the popular anime *Frieren*.

## About This Project

This project was built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) React curriculum.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned to use `useEffect` effectively for fetching data from external sources such as APIs. I also developed a stronger understanding of `useRef` for persisting objects across renders, improved my skills with `useState` and props, and gained a deeper appreciation for building smaller, reusable components.
